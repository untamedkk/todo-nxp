# TODO

## Database Setup

- Open `.env` file and change the relevant database information into the file.

- Open `data.sql`file in the `server` folder and execute the SQL queries in the batabase IDE in order to create the database and table.

## Dependencies Installation

- Make sure you are in project root folder and run `env=server npm install` and `env=client npm install`. After this the project dependencies should be installed in the system.

## Run the project

### For running the server : `npm run server`

### For running the client : `npm run client`

## Future implementation and improvement
- Model/Request validators
- ORM
- Extra test cases
- More abstraction
